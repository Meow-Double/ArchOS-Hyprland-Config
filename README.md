A configuration file for the Arch desktop environment and the hyprland window manager. The configuration file includes hyprland, hyprlock, rofi, cava, and wayba. The main script allows you to change your wallpaper. A color palette will be generated using this color palette (using pywal). Configuration files for other utilities will be generated based on these colors. IMPORTANT: This configuration file is still under development, so some features may not work!
